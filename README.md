# OneMaxOneMin
Evolutionary algorithm implementation for the OneMax and OneMin problem.

## Simple evolutionary algorithm

The simplest version of the EA found in `simpleEA.py`. 

## Evolutonary algorithm with elitism

This one can be found in `elitismEA.py`, it has an additional `elitism_count` parameter that keeps the  _fittest_ population members over generations.

## Comparison

In `main.py`, there is a comparison between an algorithm with and without elitism.
